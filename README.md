# 🔐 Cryptography Algorithms in Java

This project includes our Java implementations of four main cryptography algorithms:

- **LFSR** – Linear Feedback Shift Register  
- **DES** – Data Encryption Standard  
- **AES** – Advanced Encryption Standard  
- **RSA** – Rivest–Shamir–Adleman

We built all of them from scratch during our studies to understand how each algorithm works internally. We didn’t use any built-in Java crypto libraries — just pure Java and logic. This is a learning project and not meant for real-world security or production use.
