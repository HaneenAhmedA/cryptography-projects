# cryptography-projects
This repo includes our Java implementations of some important cryptographic algorithms: LFSR, DES, AES, and RSA. We worked on this as students to understand how these algorithms actually work under the hood, without using built-in crypto libraries. It’s just for learning and experimenting — not for real security use!
